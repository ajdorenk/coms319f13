****Ideas for Site****

1. Should we have a seller rating and a buyer rating?
	Yes - 
	No - All
	Answer: Just have a seller rating system

2. What info should we collect from users for account?
	-Name (First, Last)
	-School Attending -> maybe check from email
	-Major
	-Collect Birthday, maybe only reveal the age to public
	-Email Address 
	-Timestamp of account creation

3. For accounts setup keep track of:
	-Ratings
	-Views
	-Number of transactions participated in

4. X number of days after transaction takes place, send email to users asking to fill out survey about how the transaction went.  
	-In survey, ask the party to rate the other party
	-Automate this process.
	CANCEL THIS IDEA - No need
